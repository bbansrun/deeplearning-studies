## Supervised / Unsupervised Learning

### Supervised Learning

- Learning with labeled examples - `training set`
- Most common problem type in ML
  - **Image Labeling** : learning from tagged images
  - **Email Spam Filter**: learning from labled (spam or ham) email
  - **Predicting exam score** : learning from previous exam score and time spent

#### Types

- Predicting final exam score based on time spent
  - Regression
- Pass/Non-pass based on time spent
  - binary classification
- Letter grade (A, B, C, E and F) based on time spent
  - multi-label classification

### Unsupervised learning

- un-labeled data
